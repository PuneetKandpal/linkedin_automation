    "markdownContent": "The traditional **SaaS model** is being quietly disrupted by **AI agents** that don’t just *support* workflows but actively **execute them end-to-end**. Instead of users clicking through dashboards, configuring rules, and stitching together tools, agent-native systems observe intent, reason over context, and take autonomous action across multiple systems. This collapses entire layers of UI, onboarding, and manual configuration that SaaS products historically depended on. Where SaaS sold *features*, agents sell *outcomes*—closing tickets, publishing content, reconciling data, or negotiating decisions in real time. As agents learn continuously from feedback and environment signals, they improve without traditional release cycles, making static feature roadmaps less relevant. Over time, the value shifts from owning a single tool to orchestrating intelligence across tools, pushing software from “products you operate” to **systems that operate on your behalf**."
